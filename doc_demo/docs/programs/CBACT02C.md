## Dependency Context

> This section shows how **CBACT02C** connects to the rest of the system — who calls it,
> what it calls, and what data it shares. If linked programs exist, they must appear here.

### Programs That Call CBACT02C (Callers)

extracted from the copybook source file (`.cpy`).

## Known Issues & Code Anomalies

Static analysis flagged the following items in this program. Migration teams should
review each one before re-implementing in a modern stack.

| Severity | Category | Title | Paragraph | Line |
|----------|----------|-------|-----------|------|
| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `FD-CARD-DATA` is declared but never referenced | None | 40 |
| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `CARDFILE-STAT1` is declared but never referenced | None | 47 |
| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `CARDFILE-STAT2` is declared but never referenced | None | 48 |
| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `TWO-BYTES-LEFT` is declared but never referenced | None | 55 |
| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `IO-STATUS-0401` is declared but never referenced | None | 58 |
| **NOTICE** | LOGIC | Paragraph `1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT` terminates the program on error | 1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT | 92 |
| **NOTICE** | LOGIC | Paragraph `0000-CARDFILE-OPEN` terminates the program on error | 0000-CARDFILE-OPEN | 118 |
| **NOTICE** | LOGIC | Paragraph `9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE` terminates the program on error | 9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE | 136 |
| **NOTICE** | DEPENDENCY | Static CALL to external `CEE3ABD` (not in this codebase) | None | 158 |

### NOTICE — Variable `FD-CARD-DATA` is declared but never referenced

`FD-CARD-DATA` is declared at line 40 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 40):
```cobol
05 FD-CARD-DATA                      PIC X(134).
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Variable `CARDFILE-STAT1` is declared but never referenced

`CARDFILE-STAT1` is declared at line 47 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 47):
```cobol
05  CARDFILE-STAT1      PIC X.
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Variable `CARDFILE-STAT2` is declared but never referenced

`CARDFILE-STAT2` is declared at line 48 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 48):
```cobol
05  CARDFILE-STAT2      PIC X.
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Variable `TWO-BYTES-LEFT` is declared but never referenced

`TWO-BYTES-LEFT` is declared at line 55 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 55):
```cobol
05  TWO-BYTES-LEFT      PIC X.
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Variable `IO-STATUS-0401` is declared but never referenced

`IO-STATUS-0401` is declared at line 58 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 58):
```cobol
05  IO-STATUS-0401      PIC 9   VALUE 0.
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT` terminates the program on error

`1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `0000-CARDFILE-OPEN` terminates the program on error

`0000-CARDFILE-OPEN` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE` terminates the program on error

`9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Static CALL to external `CEE3ABD` (not in this codebase)

`CALL 'CEE3ABD'` appears in the source but `CEE3ABD` is not a program in the loaded codebase. IBM Language Environment ABEND service (forces program termination with a user code).
**Source excerpt** (line 158):
```cobol
CALL 'CEE3ABD' USING ABCODE, TIMING.
```

**Recommendation:** Document this external dependency in the Migration Notes — the modern equivalent must replicate its behaviour.
---


## File OPEN / CLOSE Operations

The exact OPEN mode (INPUT / OUTPUT / I-O / EXTEND) determines whether a file can be
read, written, or both — and whether REWRITE / DELETE are legal. This table is the
source of truth for migrators converting to modern storage layers.

| File | Operation | Mode | Paragraph | Line |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|------|
| `CARDFILE-FILE` | OPEN | INPUT | 0000-CARDFILE-OPEN | 120 |
| `CARDFILE-FILE` | CLOSE | None | 9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE | 138 |







## Modernization Review Findings

These are source-derived review notes that should be checked before translating this program into Java, Spring Boot, SQL, APIs, or batch jobs.

| Finding | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Nested IF blocks need compiler-accurate validation | Nested conditional logic was detected. During migration, validate scope with the original compiler rules and explicit `END-IF`/period termination before translating to Java or SQL. |


## Business Rules

- **Card File Read Successful** `BR-061`  
  If a card record is successfully read from the input file, the system proceeds to process the card data.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-061.md)
- **Card File End of File** `BR-062`  
  When the end of the card input file is reached, the system closes the card file and proceeds to the program's termination logic.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-062.md)
- **Card File Open Successful** `BR-063`  
  The card file must open successfully before processing can continue.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-063.md)
- **Card File Open Unsuccessful** `BR-064`  
  If the card file cannot be opened, the batch process will terminate.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-064.md)
- **Card File Close Successful** `BR-065`  
  The card file must be closed successfully after processing all card records.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-065.md)
- **Card File Close Unsuccessful** `BR-066`  
  If the card file cannot be closed successfully, the program must terminate abnormally.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-066.md)
- **File Open Successful** `BR-067`  
  The card file must open successfully before processing can continue.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-067.md)
- **File Read Successful** `BR-068`  
  The card file must be read successfully to process card records.
