## Dependency Context

> This section shows how **CBACT03C** connects to the rest of the system — who calls it,
> what it calls, and what data it shares. If linked programs exist, they must appear here.

The following copybooks are included by this program. Each entry shows the actual fields
extracted from the copybook source file (`.cpy`).

### Copybook `CVACT03Y`

|-------|-------|-----|-------|--------|-------|
| `01` | `CARD-XREF-RECORD` | `None` | None | None |  |

## File Record Layouts (FD)

This program declares the following file records (data contracts for I/O):

### `FD XREFFILE-FILE` (record `FD-XREFFILE-REC`)

| Level | Field | PIC | USAGE | Parent |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|--------|

## Data Lineage (MOVE Flow)

The following MOVE statements were extracted from the source. Each row is a `source → destination`
flow that the migration team can use to trace how data is reshaped and routed.

## Known Issues & Code Anomalies

Static analysis flagged the following items in this program. Migration teams should
review each one before re-implementing in a modern stack.

| Severity | Category | Title | Paragraph | Line |
|----------|----------|-------|-----------|------|
| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `FD-XREF-DATA` is declared but never referenced | None | 40 |

| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `XREFFILE-STAT2` is declared but never referenced | None | 48 |
| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `TWO-BYTES-LEFT` is declared but never referenced | None | 55 |
| **NOTICE** | DEAD_CODE | Variable `IO-STATUS-0401` is declared but never referenced | None | 58 |

| **NOTICE** | DEPENDENCY | Static CALL to external `CEE3ABD` (not in this codebase) | None | 158 |

### NOTICE — Variable `FD-XREF-DATA` is declared but never referenced

`FD-XREF-DATA` is declared at line 40 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 40):
```cobol
05 FD-XREF-DATA                      PIC X(34).
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Variable `XREFFILE-STAT1` is declared but never referenced

`XREFFILE-STAT1` is declared at line 47 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 47):
```cobol
05  XREFFILE-STAT1      PIC X.
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Variable `XREFFILE-STAT2` is declared but never referenced

`XREFFILE-STAT2` is declared at line 48 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 48):
```cobol
05  XREFFILE-STAT2      PIC X.
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Variable `TWO-BYTES-LEFT` is declared but never referenced

`TWO-BYTES-LEFT` is declared at line 55 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 55):
```cobol
05  TWO-BYTES-LEFT      PIC X.
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Variable `IO-STATUS-0401` is declared but never referenced

`IO-STATUS-0401` is declared at line 58 but no other statement reads or writes it. Likely a leftover from prior refactoring or an incomplete feature.
**Source excerpt** (line 58):
```cobol
05  IO-STATUS-0401      PIC 9   VALUE 0.
```

**Recommendation:** Remove the declaration or wire it into the logic that was originally intended.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `1000-XREFFILE-GET-NEXT` terminates the program on error

`1000-XREFFILE-GET-NEXT` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `0000-XREFFILE-OPEN` terminates the program on error

`0000-XREFFILE-OPEN` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `9000-XREFFILE-CLOSE` terminates the program on error

`9000-XREFFILE-CLOSE` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Static CALL to external `CEE3ABD` (not in this codebase)

`CALL 'CEE3ABD'` appears in the source but `CEE3ABD` is not a program in the loaded codebase. IBM Language Environment ABEND service (forces program termination with a user code).
**Source excerpt** (line 158):
```cobol
CALL 'CEE3ABD' USING ABCODE, TIMING.
```

**Recommendation:** Document this external dependency in the Migration Notes — the modern equivalent must replicate its behaviour.
---


## File OPEN / CLOSE Operations

The exact OPEN mode (INPUT / OUTPUT / I-O / EXTEND) determines whether a file can be
read, written, or both — and whether REWRITE / DELETE are legal. This table is the
source of truth for migrators converting to modern storage layers.

| File | Operation | Mode | Paragraph | Line |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|------|
| `XREFFILE-FILE` | OPEN | INPUT | 0000-XREFFILE-OPEN | 120 |
| `XREFFILE-FILE` | CLOSE | None | 9000-XREFFILE-CLOSE | 138 |







## Modernization Review Findings

These are source-derived review notes that should be checked before translating this program into Java, Spring Boot, SQL, APIs, or batch jobs.

| Finding | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Nested IF blocks need compiler-accurate validation | Nested conditional logic was detected. During migration, validate scope with the original compiler rules and explicit `END-IF`/period termination before translating to Java or SQL. |


## Business Rules

- **Cross-Reference File Read Error** `BR-069`  
  If there is a problem reading a record from the card cross-reference file, the system should display an error message indicating the file status.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-069.md)
- **End of Cross-Reference File Processing** `BR-070`  
  When the end of the card cross-reference file is reached, the system should close the file and proceed to the next step.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-070.md)
- **Cross-Reference File Open Successful** `BR-071`  
  The cross-reference file must open successfully before processing can continue.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-071.md)
- **Cross-Reference File Read Successful** `BR-072`  
  The cross-reference file must be read successfully.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-072.md)
- **Cross-Reference File Close Successful** `BR-073`  
  The cross-reference file should be closed successfully at the end of processing.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-073.md)
- **Handle Cross-Reference File Close Error** `BR-074`  
  If an error occurs while closing the cross-reference file, the program should handle the error.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-074.md)
- **Cross-Reference File Read Error** `BR-075`  
  If there is an issue reading the cross-reference file, the program will display an error message.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-075.md)
- **Cross-Reference File Write Error** `BR-076`  
  If there is an issue writing to the cross-reference file, the program will display an error message.
