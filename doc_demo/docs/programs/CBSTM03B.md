## Business Purpose

*Business purpose is not present in the extracted data. Run LLM enrichment to populate this section.*



## Dependency Context

> This section shows how **CBSTM03B** connects to the rest of the system — who calls it,
> what it calls, and what data it shares. If linked programs exist, they must appear here.

### Programs That Call CBSTM03B (Callers)

*No programs call CBSTM03B — this is likely a top-level entry point or CICS transaction starter.*

### Programs Called by CBSTM03B (Callees)

*CBSTM03B does not call any other programs (leaf program).*

### Shared Data (Copybooks & Files)

*No shared copybooks.*

#### Shared Files

| File | Type | Access | Also Used By |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| `ACCT-FILE` | VSAM | RANDOM |  |
| `CUST-FILE` | VSAM | RANDOM |  |
| `TRNX-FILE` | VSAM | SEQUENTIAL |  |
| `XREF-FILE` | VSAM | SEQUENTIAL | CBACT04C, CBTRN01C, CBTRN02C, CBTRN03C |

## Legacy Data Contracts

> These tables are derived from FILE SECTION records and COPY-expanded data declarations. They preserve the legacy field names, COBOL storage type, inferred modern type, and status-code values needed for Java DTOs, SQL schemas, API contracts, and migration mapping.

## Data Lineage (MOVE Flow)

The following MOVE statements were extracted from the source. Each row is a `source → destination`
flow that the migration team can use to trace how data is reshaped and routed.

## External Runtime Parameters

This program receives the following parameters at runtime (via `PROCEDURE DIVISION USING`
or `ENTRY USING`). Each parameter must be supplied by the caller — typically a JCL job
step (`PARM=`), CICS COMMAREA, or the IMS region controller. The migration target needs
an equivalent input wiring.

| # | Parameter | Source | Declared at line |
|---|-----------|--------|------------------|
| 0 | `LK-M03B-AREA` | PROCEDURE DIVISION USING | 114 |

## File OPEN / CLOSE Operations

The exact OPEN mode (INPUT / OUTPUT / I-O / EXTEND) determines whether a file can be
read, written, or both — and whether REWRITE / DELETE are legal. This table is the
source of truth for migrators converting to modern storage layers.

| File | Operation | Mode | Paragraph | Line |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|------|
| `VALUE` | CLOSE | None | None | 104 |
| `TRNX-FILE` | OPEN | INPUT | 1000-TRNXFILE-PROC | 136 |
| `TRNX-FILE` | CLOSE | None | 1000-TRNXFILE-PROC | 147 |
| `XREF-FILE` | OPEN | INPUT | 2000-XREFFILE-PROC | 160 |
| `XREF-FILE` | CLOSE | None | 2000-XREFFILE-PROC | 171 |
| `CUST-FILE` | OPEN | INPUT | 3000-CUSTFILE-PROC | 184 |
| `CUST-FILE` | CLOSE | None | 3000-CUSTFILE-PROC | 196 |
| `ACCT-FILE` | OPEN | INPUT | 4000-ACCTFILE-PROC | 209 |
| `ACCT-FILE` | CLOSE | None | 4000-ACCTFILE-PROC | 221 |







## Modernization Review Findings

These are source-derived review notes that should be checked before translating this program into Java, Spring Boot, SQL, APIs, or batch jobs.

| Finding | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Nested IF blocks need compiler-accurate validation | Nested conditional logic was detected. During migration, validate scope with the original compiler rules and explicit `END-IF`/period termination before translating to Java or SQL. |
