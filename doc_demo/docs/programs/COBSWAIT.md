## Business Purpose

*Business purpose is not present in the extracted data. Run LLM enrichment to populate this section.*



## Dependency Context

> This section shows how **COBSWAIT** connects to the rest of the system — who calls it,
> what it calls, and what data it shares. If linked programs exist, they must appear here.

### Programs That Call COBSWAIT (Callers)

*No programs call COBSWAIT — this is likely a top-level entry point or CICS transaction starter.*

### Programs Called by COBSWAIT (Callees)

*COBSWAIT does not call any other programs (leaf program).*

### Shared Data (Copybooks & Files)

*No shared copybooks.*


## Legacy Data Contracts

> These tables are derived from FILE SECTION records and COPY-expanded data declarations. They preserve the legacy field names, COBOL storage type, inferred modern type, and status-code values needed for Java DTOs, SQL schemas, API contracts, and migration mapping.




*No concrete file or copybook record layouts were found for this program.*

## Paragraphs


## Executed by JCL Jobs

This program is run by the following batch JCL jobs:

| Job Name | Step | Step Comments |

## Data Lineage (MOVE Flow)

The following MOVE statements were extracted from the source. Each row is a `source → destination`
flow that the migration team can use to trace how data is reshaped and routed.

| Source | Destination | Paragraph | Line |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------|
| `PARM-VALUE` | `MVSWAIT-TIME` | None | 37 |


## Known Issues & Code Anomalies

Static analysis flagged the following items in this program. Migration teams should
review each one before re-implementing in a modern stack.

| Severity | Category | Title | Paragraph | Line |
|----------|----------|-------|-----------|------|
| **NOTICE** | DEPENDENCY | Static CALL to external `MVSWAIT` (not in this codebase) | None | 38 |

### NOTICE — Static CALL to external `MVSWAIT` (not in this codebase)

`CALL 'MVSWAIT'` appears in the source but `MVSWAIT` is not a program in the loaded codebase. Custom MVS wait subroutine.
**Source excerpt** (line 38):
```cobol
CALL 'MVSWAIT'       USING MVSWAIT-TIME.
```

**Recommendation:** Document this external dependency in the Migration Notes — the modern equivalent must replicate its behaviour.
