## Business Purpose

*Business purpose is not present in the extracted data. Run LLM enrichment to populate this section.*



## Dependency Context

> This section shows how **COBTUPDT** connects to the rest of the system — who calls it,
> what it calls, and what data it shares. If linked programs exist, they must appear here.

### Programs That Call COBTUPDT (Callers)

*No programs call COBTUPDT — this is likely a top-level entry point or CICS transaction starter.*

### Programs Called by COBTUPDT (Callees)

*COBTUPDT does not call any other programs (leaf program).*

### Shared Data (Copybooks & Files)

*No shared copybooks.*

#### Shared Files

### NOTICE — Paragraph `1001-READ-NEXT-RECORDS` terminates the program on error

`1001-READ-NEXT-RECORDS` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `1003-TREAT-RECORD` terminates the program on error

`1003-TREAT-RECORD` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `10031-INSERT-DB` terminates the program on error

`10031-INSERT-DB` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `10032-UPDATE-DB` terminates the program on error

`10032-UPDATE-DB` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.
---
### NOTICE — Paragraph `10033-DELETE-DB` terminates the program on error

`10033-DELETE-DB` calls an ABEND routine (or STOP RUN) on the failure path. This means an error here ENDS the entire program — it does NOT reject, skip, or log-and-continue. Documentation must use "abend" / "terminate" language, not "reject".

**Recommendation:** Use ‘abend’ or ‘terminates the program’ when describing the error path of this paragraph.

## File OPEN / CLOSE Operations

The exact OPEN mode (INPUT / OUTPUT / I-O / EXTEND) determines whether a file can be
read, written, or both — and whether REWRITE / DELETE are legal. This table is the
source of truth for migrators converting to modern storage layers.

| File | Operation | Mode | Paragraph | Line |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|------|
| `TR-RECORD` | OPEN | INPUT | 0001-OPEN-FILES | 83 |
| `TR-RECORD` | CLOSE | None | 2001-CLOSE-STOP | 235 |


## Decision Tables (EVALUATE / WHEN)

Captured from the source. Each EVALUATE block is a structured decision the
migration team should turn into either a switch / pattern-match or a rules table.

### EVALUATE `INPUT-REC-TYPE` — paragraph `1003-TREAT-RECORD` (line 122)

| WHEN | Action |
|------|--------|
| **WHEN OTHER** | STRING |
| `'A'` | DISPLAY 'ADDING RECORD' |
| `'U'` | DISPLAY 'UPDATING RECORD' |
| `'D'` | DISPLAY 'DELETING RECORD' |
| `'*'` | DISPLAY 'IGNORING COMMENTED LINE' |

### EVALUATE `TRUE` — paragraph `10031-INSERT-DB` (line 152)

| WHEN | Action |
|------|--------|
| `SQLCODE = ZERO` | DISPLAY 'RECORD INSERTED SUCCESSFULLY' |
| `SQLCODE < 0` | STRING |

### EVALUATE `TRUE` — paragraph `10032-UPDATE-DB` (line 178)

| WHEN | Action |
|------|--------|
| `SQLCODE = ZERO` | DISPLAY 'RECORD UPDATED SUCCESSFULLY' |
| `SQLCODE = +100` | STRING 'No records found.' DELIMITED BY SIZE |
| `SQLCODE < 0` | STRING |

### EVALUATE `TRUE` — paragraph `10033-DELETE-DB` (line 208)

| WHEN | Action |
|------|--------|
| `SQLCODE = ZERO` | DISPLAY 'RECORD DELETED SUCCESSFULLY' |
| `SQLCODE = +100` | STRING 'No records found.' DELIMITED BY SIZE |
| `SQLCODE < 0` | STRING |






## Modernization Review Findings

These are source-derived review notes that should be checked before translating this program into Java, Spring Boot, SQL, APIs, or batch jobs.

| Finding | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Nested IF blocks need compiler-accurate validation | Nested conditional logic was detected. During migration, validate scope with the original compiler rules and explicit `END-IF`/period termination before translating to Java or SQL. |

  When a transaction record indicates a delete operation, remove an existing record from the database.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-038.md)
- **Record Type Validation** `BR-039`  
  The system determines the type of database update (insert, update, or delete) based on a record type code within the transaction record.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-039.md)
- **Transaction Type Validation** `BR-040`  
  The system determines the type of database update (insert, update, or delete) based on a record type code within the transaction record.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-040.md)
- **Delete Record Validation** `BR-041`  
  If the database delete operation fails, set the DB2 delete status code to 'DB2-DELETE-ERROR'.  
  [View Rule Details](../business-rules/BR-041.md)
- **Delete Record Failure Handling** `BR-042`  
  If the database delete operation fails, set the overall program return code to 8.
